            <p>Hello! My name is Ahmed, a 20 year-old junior developer from Sudan and
                I like to develop many different types of software such as websites (like this), mobile apps, video games and more.
                Throughout my shortish career, I've been involved in multiple projects ranging from simple websites to
                artificial intelligence chatbots and blockchain software. After getting some hands-on proffesional experience across several projects,
                I thought it was about time I made my own portfolio to better showcase and document some of my skillsets and expertise.
                When I'm not developing, I can be found either playing video games, swimming, exercising or participating in online programming
                competetitions (well, I just started haha).
